Youtube Sync App

I build this app in order to watch youtube videos with my friends at the same time.

Stack: React js, Node js, Express js, Socket.io, React-Bootstrap.

Features:

1. Create room and username.
2. Enter in existing rooms.
3. Real time chat in room.
4. Real time online users in room.
5. Real time youtube video synchronization (play/pause/duration/seeking).
6. Room dies if it is empty.

This is version 1, version 2 coming soon with many features.
